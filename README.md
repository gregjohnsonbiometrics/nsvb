# nsvb
A C++ implementation of National Scale Volume and Biomass estimators (`NSVB`) 

## Introduction

The National Scale Volume and Biomass Estimators[^1] (`NSVB`) were implemented in R[^2] by Virginia Tech. The performance of the code is hampered by the interpretive nature of R. To provide a higher performance API the Virginia Tech code is implemented in C++23.

## Biomass Components Estimated

The dry weight in pounds is estimated for the following tree components:

* Wood
* Bark
* Branches
* Foliage
* Total

Additionally, aboveground biomass (AGB) is computed.

## Additional Estimators

Functions are included to compute total cubic foot volume inside and outside bark using the `NSVB` system.

## Application Programming Interface

The following functions are exposed:

* `biomass_components()`: Computes biomass components in pounds given: 
   * FIA numeric species code (`fia_spp`), 
   * FIA ecological division[^3] (`division`), 
   * total inside bark volume of tree (top and stump) (`vtotib`), 
   * diameter at breast height (`dbh`) in inches, and 
   * total height (`tht`) in feet.
* `compute_green_tons()`: Compute green tons outside bark of a log given:
   * `fia_spp`, 
   * total outside bark volume of merchantable stem (cubic feet) (`cfvolob`),
   * total outside bark volume of merchantable stem (cubic feet) (`cfvolib`).
* `compute_volib()`: Computes total cubic volume inside bark (`vtotib`) (cubic feet) given:
   * `fia_spp`,
   * `division`,
   * `dbh`,
   * `tht`.
* `compute_volob()`: Computes total cubic volume outside bark (`vtotob`) (cubic feet) given:
   * `fia_spp`,
   * `division`,
   * `dbh`,
   * `tht`.

`biomass_components` returns a `BIOMASS_COMP` structure defined in `nsvb.hpp`. 

## Compilation

A [simple program](./test/test.cpp) is available to test your compilation. It accepts `fia_spp`, `dbh`, `tht`, and optionally `division` on the command line. The `makefile` compiles and optionally executes the test program. A successful compilation following by running `test` should result in:

```text
species = 202, division = M240, dbh = 10, height = 60
Total Volume Inside Bark (cubic feet) = 12.22
Total Volume Outside Bark (cubic feet) = 15.83
Green Lbs = 652.2
Biomass
        AGB     =       518.6
        Bark    =       56.4
        Branch  =       94.35
        foliage =       40.21
        wood    =       327.7
        total   =       478.4
```

## Notes

1. The `NSVB` makes a direct estimate of total biomass. A separate estimate of total biomass is computed as a sum of the biomass components of the tree. The component estimates are rebalanced to scale to the direct estimate.
2. Green tons are estimated using specific gravity and moisture content values from Miles and Smith (2009)[^4].
